## Story

USThing wanted to develop a new feature to show academic progress of a student in the app. We can scrape Stendent Center, which serve a page called Academic Requirement. The page shows all the requirement that the student need to fullfill, for example: common core, English, Chinese, major, additional major, minor, option.
