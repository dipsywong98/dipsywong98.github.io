Contains over 70 articles on techniques using Twilight Wars campaign maker to make custom games. I founded the team and coauth the articles with other experienced maker in the community. It has been the largest and most frequently referenced tutorial website in the community. The techniques covers map making, variables, effects, hacks and maths in making games and the website has a very possitive impression in the community.

It was made in old google sites which was deprecated by google. Here is a backup of the website https://dipsy.me/twftechnique/home.html .
