# Mario Kart Tour Advisor
> Little helper to analyse usefulnes of your drivers/karts/gliders and the performance of courses in Mario Kart Tour
> Authors: [Dipsy Wong](//github.com/dipsywong98)

Hey guys, I made a website to analyze the usefulness of your drivers/karts/gliders and the performance of courses in Mario Kart Tour.

https://dipsy.me/MKTA/

## Features

By setting up what drivers you have, you can see your

1. course performance: which course you are lacking frenzy drivers
1. unique drivers: they are the only frenzy drivers you have in some courses
1. wish list: by unlocking these drivers you can start frenzying in some courses

so as for karts and gliders.

Hope you guys will like it, feedbacks or contributions are welcome :)

(Was thinking to make a minimum covering of cards on courses, that is in order to use the minimum number of drivers to frenzy all courses, which drivers would I need to obtain, not sure would this a good feature to add. If you have any good features to recommend just tell me here)
