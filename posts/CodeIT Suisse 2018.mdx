CodeIT Suisse is a programming competition organized by Credit Suisse.

In short, the submission is in a form of a backend server, in our case written mainly with Node and bridges Python codes, full of RESTful APIs. The competition contains 11 algorithm or machine learning challenges, and as we receive inputs of the challenges from GET requests, we need to return the outputs within time limit.

(Questions)[https://dipsy.me/CodeIT-2018-site-backup/]

I attempted Broadcaster, Sorting game, Tetris and Skill tree.

What make this programming contest interesting is that we are free to use any tools to solve the problems. So in sorting game, I just installed an npm package and write an adaptor to solve the problem in an hour, and in the tetris question I copy paste an open sourced tetris AI in Github to obtain a good amount of score. It is full of fun to attend the contest and encouraged me to apply Credit Suisse internship, and I got in to it successfully.
