## Basic Requirement

- [x] Adding curve types (make the curve evaluator)
  - [x] B-spline
  - [x] Bezier
  - [x] Catmullrom
- [x] Wrapping
- [x] Particle System Simulation (forces)
- [x] Baking (simulate once and store it)
- [x] Hierarchy particle system (apply transformation to the particle system)
- [x] Hoke up particle system
- [x] Animation artifact (call `endDraw()`)

## Bonus

- [ ] (3W max, 1 each) Curves enhancement
  - [X] CatmullRom Tension (tab to slider)
  - [ ] C3/C4 continuous
  - [ ] Subdivision curve (Lane-Riesenfeld or Dyn-Levin-Gregory)
  - [ ] User-specified derivatives at C2 spline
  - [ ] Enforce C0 C1 between Bezier curve
  - [ ] Add new control point without changing the curve
- [ ] (1W) TGA
- [ ] (1W) Mirror
- [ ] (1W) Billboarding - Spectacular effect http://www.lighthouse3d.com/opengl/billboarding/
  - [ ] (1W) Fire
  - [ ] (1W) Snow
  - [ ] (1W) Water fountain
  - [ ] (1W) Fireworks
- [ ] (1W) Environment mapping for reflection
- [ ] (1W) Motion Blur
- [ ] (1W) Skyboxes - background
- [ ] (1W) Higher order simulation - Runge-Kutta technique
- [ ] (1W) openGL speed up
- [ ] (1W) Adaptive Bezier curve generation
- [ ] (1B) Spring particle system
- [ ] (1B) Bouncing particle system
- [ ] (1B) General subdivision curve
- [x] (1B) Height Fields
- [ ] (1B) Metaball with environment mapping
- [ ] (1B1W) lens flare
- [ ] (1B1W) improvement on UI
- [ ] (2B) Flocking (particles need to have orientation)
- [ ] (2B) C2 interpolating curve
- [ ] (2B) Handled Catmull-Rom
- [ ] (2B) Select part of model by click image
- [ ] (2B) Avoid gimbal lock
- [ ] (2B) Draw bspline surface
- [ ] (3B) Projected texture
- [ ] (3B) Motion warping
- [ ] (3B) Cell shading (cartoon shade)
- [ ] (4B) Rigid body simulation
- [ ] (4B) Subdivision surface
- [ ] (MB) IK - need select part of model
- [ ] (MB) Interactive physically based animation - need rigid body

P.S: Oh well we were too busy doing game programming project, so this time we only get 1 bell (lose 0.5 since my height fields is not animating) but so what in overall we were still the second most bonus holder and got an A+
(I am the rank 6, and please don't compare me with the crazy couple of rank 1 and 3, they are just from another entirely different level)
