This is an embedded system library for k60 chip, developed by smart car seniors since long time ago. It cantains three parts

1. libbase - drivers of the chip itself, for example pin control, protocals like gpio, i2c, uart, pwm etc.
2. libsc - drivers for external connection, for example button, motor, encoder, camera, lcd, etc.
3. libutil - higher lever library, for example menu, touchscreen keyboard

I implemented some pin config, touchscreen keyboard and driver for nfc reader
