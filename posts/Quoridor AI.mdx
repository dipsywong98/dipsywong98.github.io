## Story
NXP Intelligent racing creative category is a [quoridor game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor) between two robots without any manual control. This project acts as a backup plan if deep reinforcement learning strategy fails. I made this within a few days using [alpha-beta pruning minimax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) which I leant from the game programming course. I tried negamax pruning tree but it does not work well.
