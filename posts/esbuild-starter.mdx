Uses esbuild to build express server and ~~create-react-app~~ vite and run jest. Also included eslint and github actions. To get started, git clone this repo and run yarn

This template includes:

- esbuild typescript express server
- typescript ~~create react app~~ react vite
- esbuild jest for server acceptance and create react app unit test
- github action that runs tests and creates releases on tag

I used esbuild to bundled both frontend and backend code. Bundling backend code allows me to start the server by simply `node index.js` and I dont need to install node_modules or run docker command. The template allows me to kick start typescript fullstack projects quickly, and I used it to kickstart a few projects already - [mini-deployer](/posts/mini-deployer), [mirror-on-wall](/posts/mirror-on-wall), first generation of [calenytics](/posts/calenytics), [ig-helper](/posts/ig-helper)
