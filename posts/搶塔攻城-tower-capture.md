This is the most complex twf game I have built since I have started making game using twf the mission creator inside Twilight Wars.

Game machanics:

- City building to unlock features and resource generation
- Tower capture to defense other parties
- Hunting to earn exp, money and special items
- Barrat to recruit troops
- Cottage for buying spells
- Weapon factory to buy weapons
- Reinforcement factory to upgrade weapons
- laboratory to unlock technologies
- Arsenal to manufacture heavy war machines like tanks and helicoper and controllable by players
- Destroy opponents' main tower to win

However I rolled out all the above features at once, so that the tunning is bad and I think the game play is not that good, and it is too complex.
