## Story

This is the second version of my personal homepage dipsyland [(the first one)](//dipsywong98.github.io/homepage1). I am making this one for three **reasons**:

1. My first generation website is too _dirty_
    1.  It is _a plain html with simple vue templates_
        --  super long index.html
        --  hard to maintain since I don't want to look at this shit again.
    3.  It requires a _logo for each work_ which I don't have time to make
        --  lots of default logo
        --  my site looks ugly and boring.
    5.  It requires me _manually maintain_ a json file to display the list of works and notes and the content needs to be _embedded inside the json file_ 
        -- hard to update my works and blogs
        -- I didn't update my website for long

2. I want to **practice** more frontend skill
    1. Yes I think _my front end skill was really shit_. I feel really jealous when I see my partner [Daniel](//github.com/danvim) make the [ScoreBoard](https://scoreboard-d.firebaseapp.com/) extremely beautiful by just using CSS, in contrast with my minimalism admin panel. Yeah it just works but quite ugly hmmm.
    2. So this time I want to _challenge myself_ to make a good looking website _without using component libraries_.

3. I just want to have **fun**
    _(YEEEEEE I think this is the most important reason YO)_

Anyway I just started this project since Jan 2018 when travelling, with **three goals** to achieve:

1. **No component libraries!** Hardcore mode! But at the same time nice looking and fun!
2. **Explore the unknowns**, like typescript, pug, scss, testing frameworks
3. **Convenent** to dynamically update works and blogs

Then I challenge myself with two wonderful frontend features:

1. Parallex 2.5D dipsyland bannar with animation
2. Ripple to full screen effect

And then I just did it in a few days with reference to some components libraries by trying to understand how they did it. Thanks to the pioneers.

Afterwards it was the spring semester and I stopped the development since the graphics and game programming course were just too fun and time consumming, and then I had internship and worked for FYP during summer, and another very intensive computer vision course in fall semeseter, finally I restarted the homepage2 duing Christmas holiday, and I completed it as a _Christmas present_ for myself yeah. (same as how homepage1 was borned what the actual fuck)

Three additional features were added since the restart of the project:

1. Works/ blog display with **dynamic filtering**
2. Works/ blog **update** using yml and md file **outside of the repo**
3. **Helper script to build and deploy** the whole site to github pages (github pages cannot show .vue files directly)

I think these can bring some conveniece to anyone interested in me (are there?), at least to me when I want to J my works or update the conent

To conclude, I met the **no coponent libraries** and **dynamically update** objectives, but I **give up typescript and testing frameworks** since later on I found they are just adding more works to me without much help for this project, so I just leave it. **Hope you would like dipsyland. Feel free to contact me if there are any issues~**
