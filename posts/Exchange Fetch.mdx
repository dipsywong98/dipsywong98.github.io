Back then it was time to look for exchange opportunities, and whether or not the institude provide good credit transfer is an important cretirion. However the school website back then to search for course equivalence does not fulfil my goal. The existing search can only search by location or institution name, but I want to search by UST course code and other attributes. Therefore I scraped the whole page for all institution and build my own search.

But at the end I did not apply for exchange because I am not interested in going anywhere, and instead in the semester I was planning to exchange, I took too much courses and that earned me an additional major in Maths...
