This course is essentially [Stanford cs231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/).

- Assignment1 - implementing 2 layer fully connected net with numpy
- Assignment2 - implementing batch normalization, dropout, cross-validation, CNN and learn tensorflow
- Assignment3 - implementing encoder decoder, GAN, LSTM, Network visualization, RNN, style transfer
- Assignment4 - implementing Q learning, reinforced learning, dqn

I got an A-, but I dont think I know Machine Learning :(
