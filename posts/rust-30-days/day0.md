# From Rust newbie to professional Rust web developer in 30 days

I have been doing profession web development in TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Kotlin, etc in big MNC, and acquire myself with the rightful way to do software development. Rust is a emerging programming language famous to be as fast as C++ while embracing memory safty and concurrent safety, I would like to equip myself with this powerful tool, and I am trying to learn it through creating real softwares.

There are a lot of books and tutorials on getting started with Rust, most of them are well written and explaining really. However they are primarily focus on introduction level, more on the language itself and official tools around it, there is some gap to professionally adapt Rust in actual software development. There are not a clear pathway to walkthrough what really needed to be learn to write a good rust project. While I am trying to code a good rust project, I faced many painpoints to prevent my rust project to be smelly, so I keep on searching on any existing ways to solve those problems. I am not saying my projects or opinion must be exellent or I am super proficient in rust, I am also relatively new to the rust ecosystem, this is more of sharing of knowledge and experience, in case you are facing the same problem, here are some tools that you may want to use.

I believe programming languages must be learnt through coding some real projects, instead of just looking at toy syntax, so here is the example projects that we are going to build.
