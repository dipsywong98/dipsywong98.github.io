# Amazing way to use hackmd to manage blog

Today I was trying to update my blog page. Originally it was using yaml in git repo to generate the listing of all articles and work, however I don't want to make updating blog content as a commit to my homepage, that is all commits to the homepage repo shall be related to the code base itself.

I was considering using gist, however it will generate a lot of not code gist, and difficult to manage. Then I tried to use hackmd to manage all my yaml file and md which works perfectly fine.

The yaml file uses # as comment while md uses # as title - we can just make the yaml file looks fucking pretty in hackmd but at the same time it is a syntatically correct yaml file! What a coincident! To let my website fetch the yaml or md file, just append `/download` to the hackmd page. Try this: https://hackmd.io/tWCAZ-w6Taa4NH0pwvHbWQ/download
