One of the hardest and most intensive UG Computer Science course in HKUST, 7 programming projects in 13 weeks. ~~Thanks god our super difficult final is cancelled~~.

0. Matlab warm-up
1. image filtering and hough transform
2. augmented reality and planar homography
3. 3D reconstruction
4. physics-based vision
5. scene recognition with bag of words
6. digit recognition with CNN
7. tracking objects in videos

## 1. image filtering and hough transform

Pipeline that applies kernals and hough transform to detect straight line edges

1. original image

## 2. augmented reality and planar homography

Feature detectors (FAST/ Harris corner detections), feature descriptors (BRIEF, filter bank), homography, RANSAC, Panorama

1. Extract and match the features

2. Compute the homography and map new image

## 4. Physic based reconstruction

Given albedo and normal, render model under different light source

## 5. scene recognition with bag of words

Given a set of filters, set of training images, sample some points using random or corners, compute their filter responses, k-mean cluster the responses as dictionary. Then map each pixel of all images into words in the dictionary, this word map then convert into a histogram counting the relative frequency of each word. Next use image feature distance/ NN/ kNN/ SVM to do the classification

2. filter response on LAB color system

5. classification
kNN 57.5% accuracy, k=14
![](https://github.com/dipsywong98/COMP4901L/raw/master/assgn5/saved_figures/accuracy_plot.png)
LibSVM 63.75% accuracy, HOG+SVM 80% accuracy
