## Basic Requirements

- [x] Own character (10 primitive shapes, 4 level of hierarchy)
  - [x] each level need at least one `glTranslate` `glRotate` or `glScale`
  - [x] use `glPushMatrix` and `glPopMatrix` to nest the levels
- [x] Sliders to control single component
- [x] Sliders to control a action which move multiple components at the same time
- [x] Implement `gluLookAt`
- [x] Complete 2 bells

## Bonus

B: Bell, W: Whistle, 1B=2W

- [x] **(1W)** Light source
  - [x] **(1W)** (hierarchical) level of details
  - [x] (1W each) extra feature
    - [x] Dynamic number of level of arms with ik supported
- [x] **(1B)** Texture map
- [x] **(1B)** Polygon faces shape
- [x] **(1B)** Animated sequence
- [x] (1B) Widget to control param and create individual-looking instances
- [x] **(1B)** Fit whole model in camera (Frame All)
- [x] (1B1W) an intuitive way for the user to twist the camera via mouse control.
- [x] *(2B)* New primitives (one of the followings)
  - [ ] 1. Given Curve A and B, surface form by sweep A through B
  - [x] 2. Given Curve A and stright line L, surface form by rotate A about L
  - [ ] 3. Torus
  - [ ]  4. Others base on coolness
- [x] (2B) procedural modelling with parameter control [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)
- [x] (2B) mood cycling: the model have mood reaction based on UI control
- [x] (4B) Organic shape [metaballs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs)
- [x] *(8B)* goal-oriented motion (inverse kinematics  [here](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp4411/Password_Only/projects/modeler/inverse-kinematics.pdf))
  - [x] *(4B)* constrain on joints

P.S: This is the simplest project of COMP4411, if you are taking it, do score all the bonus in this project
