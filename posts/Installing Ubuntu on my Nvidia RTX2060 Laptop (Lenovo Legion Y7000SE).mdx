# Installing Ubuntu on my Nvidia RTX2060 Laptop (Lenovo Legion Y7000SE)

Procrastinated for three years, I finally decided to buy my very first "first-hand" computer. ~~Now I am bankrupted.~~ I got it from the school's notebook ownership program which is rather worth it given the OP spec. With just 12000 HKD, I got 1TB SSD, Gen 9 i7 intel CPU core, Nvidia RTX 2060, 32GB RAM, HD screen, as well as a gigantic power supply yay~. As a ~~professional~~ IT dog, the very first thing I need to do is to install linux dual boot on it, but it has been cries and tears doing so. Took me several days TAT.

## 1. Install Nvidia Driver

I cant directly install from desktop images as it will enter a broken screen as the computer don't have Nvidia driver at fresh install.

Therefore I install ubuntu by first installing a ubuntu server, install the Nvidia driver manually, finally install the desktop.

During the installation wifi seems not working so I connect the computer with LAN.

```bash showLineNumbers
# the repository that nvidia is
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

# dynamic kernel module support
sudo apt-get install dkms build-essential

sudo apt-get update

# know what is the newest version of nvidia driver
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-drivers
ubuntu-drivers list

# install the driver
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-440
```

Then install a desktop distro. ~~I chose KDE because the desktop looks like win10, and I just joke with my non linux friends that it is win11 and they really believe in it~~.

```bash showLineNumbers
sudo tasksel
```

This will display a list of available desktops that you can install

After installing, just reboot

```bash showLineNumbers
reboot
```

## 2. Brightness control

And then brightness setting is not working

First need to enable brightness control of the GPU. Open  `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia.conf` (or maybe other file like this in the same directory) and add a line of 

```
Option "RegistryDwords" "EnableBrightnessControl=1"
```

**Everytime after you update the nvidia driver, you need to manually add back the above line.**

Then ubuntu don't know it can control the lower level setting of computer. So to enable the OS to set the low level stuffs, set the grub by modifying a line in `/etc/default/grub`

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=linux"
```

Remember to `sudo update-grub` and then restart.
You may now test the brightness control with `xbacklight -set 10` or brightness control buttons on your computer if you have.

## 3. Cannot connect to WIFI

Do this after you have installed desktop

First switch the netplan to use NetworkManager

```bash showLineNumbers
cd /etc/netplan

# Optional: backup the setting
sudo cp 01-netcfg.yaml 01-netcfg.yaml-backup

# edit the netplan
sudo vi 01-netcfg.yaml
```

Change the "ENTIRE" `01-netcfg.yaml` as follows

```yaml showLineNumbers
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# For more information, see netplan(5).
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: NetworkManager
```

```bash showLineNumbers
sudo netplan generate
sudo netplan apply
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
```

The story hasn't ended yet. idk why i dont need these for the first attempt. For each start up, you need to run these

```bash showLineNumbers
#!/bin/sh -e
sudo modprobe -r ideapad_laptop
sudo rfkill unblock all
exit 0
```

If you don't have `rfkill`, install it by `sudo apt isntall rfkill`

If you don't want to run it every time manually, you can put them as `/etc/rc.local`

```bash showLineNumbers
sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```

## 4. Chinese input

Installing Chinese in KDE is such a headache, and the input method itself is much less user friendly than that in win10. ~~But never mind when programming who use Chinese.~~

First install Chinese language pack

```bash showLineNumbers
sudo apt install language-pack-zh-hant 
```

Then check whether `zh-tw` something like that is in your locale by running

```bash showLineNumbers
locale -a
```

Next install ibus. I have not successfully tried other input libraries. ibus claims itself as new and user friendly but nah...

```bash showLineNumbers
sudo apt install ibus ibus-clutter ibus-gtk ibus-gtk3 ibus-qt4
sudo apt install ibus-cangjie  # I use cangjie
im-config -s ibus # ibus official docs said it is im-switch which is wrong
ibus-setup

sudo apt-get install gnome-icon-theme # poor KDE people need this idk why
```
add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` or you cannot use ibus in some app
```
export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
```

Finally log out and log in again will have it done :)

If the language box is not on the toolbar, run this

```bash showLineNumbers
ibus-daemon -drx 
```



## 5. Share drive with windows

I also want to share some part of the hard drive for windows, rule of thumbs

1. Always save shared documents in NTFS partition
2. Need to disable fast boot in windows and dont boot to linux when window is sleeping

And then in linux mount the drive (for me linux directly auto mount C: to `/media/storage/`), and symlink the folders in home directory to the shared drive (I just remove `~/Documents/` `~/Pictures/` etc and make some symlink that point to `C:\Users\xxxxxx\Documents` whatever in `~/`)

One interesting thing is I am even able to share the VirtualBox VMs across linux and windows.

1. Set up the VM in windows environment
2. Add the VM in Linux environment
   1. Press Ctrl+A
   2. Open `myVirtualMachine.vbox` in NTFS partition
   3. Done

## 6. Broken nvidia driver after updating bios

After I had update my bios, my entire nvidia driver breaks and back-light control is not working. My eyes hurt! (Takes me a whole night and morning to get it solved T^T)

What I did is update the nvidia driver

But then the driver is installed but not running, you can tell by

```bash showLineNumbers
# you will see a list a nvidia packages you have installed
dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia

# you will see nvidia-driver is actually not running
nvidia-smi
```

What i did is just uninstall and then install all the nvidia related packages listed in `dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia`, and then install the newest nvidia driver by the steps at #1.

And then I run https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1037160 again, it shows something like this

```

|=============================================================================|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

None of the processes are using the GPU, if I run `nvidia-settings` , it saids cannot connect to Nvidia driver whatever.

What I did is review the debug log, which is generated by `nvidia-bug-report.sh `, I see something like this

```bash showLineNumbers
nvidia-modeset: Version mismatch: nvidia.ko(440.26) nvidia-modeset.ko(435.21)
```

To solve this, I removed `nvidia-modeset.ko` and reinstall all nvidia related packages

```bash showLineNumbers
sudo rm /lib/modules/4.15.0-36-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia-modeset.ko
```

I changed `4.15.0-36-generic`to something else, anyway it should be changed to the newest one

After I setup the brightness control again in #2, my eyes are saved! Run `nvidia-smi` I can see desktop processes are actually using the GPU, and `nvidia-settings` can open a normal dialog.
