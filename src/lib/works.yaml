  description: |
      I love working on interesting side projects, most of them are [game](#) and [web](#) projects. In additional to those, I also worked on [embedded system](#), [computer graphics](#), [AI](#) and [cloud](#) projects. I pinned the 6 most interesting ones I think as [featured](#) works.
      

      When I was studying in university, besides working on [academic](#) projects, I was also a software engineer of [robotics](#) team and a developer of [USThing](#).
