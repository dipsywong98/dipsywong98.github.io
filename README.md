```sh
yarn # install dependencies
yarn dev # start dev server
yarn build # static site generation
yarn start # serve the static site
```

push to master will trigger `yarn build` and site deployment

Two major types of content:

1. list of works, each may have dev log or not

2. list of posts, each may link to a work or not
